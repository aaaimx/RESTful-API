# Resource Structure
In REST, the data we are handling is called a **resource**.
Following a consistent naming convention makes your API easier to use. It is important to follow a correct structure for our resources.

>Resourse can be a Singleton or a Collection.

For example, a **user** is a singleton , but **users** is a collection. So, we can identify a collection resource by/**users** URI. However, for a singleton resource, the  URI will become: **/users/{userID}**.

### sub-collection resources

Let's imagine a sub-collection **codes** of a unique **user**: **/users/{userID}/codes** Just like in the example above, a singleton code URI will become
```
/users/{userID}/codes/{codeID}
```

> This generally refers to the [uniform Interface](2.REST_Architectural_Constraint.md) constraint, where the same pattern repeats over the whole API.
