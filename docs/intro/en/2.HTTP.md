# What is HTTP?

**Hypertext** **Transfer** **Protocol** (HTTP) is an **application** **layer** **protocol** for transmitting **hypermedia** **documents**

By default, HTTP follows the clasic **client-server** **model**, where the client opens a connection to make a request and then waits for the server's response.

For example, a web browser (on the client computer) may be the **client** and an application running on a computer hosting a website (the server computer) may be the **server** . The client submits an **HTTP** **request** **message** to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, returns a **response** **message** to the client. The response contains **completion** **status** insformation about the request and the requested content in its message **body**.

HTTP is a **stateless** **protocol**, meaning that the server doesn't keep any data between two requests.

**HTTP** **messages** are the blocks of data sent between HTTP applications. Each message contains either a request from a client or a response from a server. They consist of three parts: a **start** **line** describing the message, a block of **headers** containing attributes, and an optional **body** containing data.
