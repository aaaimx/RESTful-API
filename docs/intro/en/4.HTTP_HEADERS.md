# HTTP Headers

**HTTP** **headers** are important parts of HTTP messages, passing along additional information along with the message body.
An HTTP header consist of **a** **name** followed by a colo ':', then by its **value**. The name is **case-insensitive**. In the example below,"**Content-Type**" is the name of the header and its value is "**image/png**".

```
Content-Type: image/png
```

There are no line breaks between the header name and value.

Typically, When working with the websites, two types of headers are sent: **Request** and **Response**. Request headers consist of data about what the client wnats to receive and about the client itself. Response headers provide more information about the resource being sent, including information such as the server name, location, version, etc.

For example, a **request** **header** may look like this:

```
GET /file.html HTTP/version
Host:  HostName
From: NameOfRequestingUser
Cache-Control: no-cache
```
The **start** **line** describes the message, meaning the server should respond to a **GET** **request** for the resource **/file.html** **Host**, **From** and **Cache-Control** are sample headers.

>There are more than 60 default header names and you can create any custom header by using alphabetical or numerical characters.
