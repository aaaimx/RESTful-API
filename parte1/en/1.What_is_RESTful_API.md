# What is RESTful API?

A **REST**ful **API** (RESTful web service),is based on Representational State Transfer (REST) technology, which is an architectural style and approach to
communications often used in web services development.

RESTful API is mostly used for [**HTTP**](2.HTTP.md) web APIs where there is no need for any additional libraries or packages to be installed.

REST itself is very **flexible**. There are not many limitations, but developers refer to best practices when archtecting a REST API. REST has the ability to handle multiple types of requests and return different types of data( such as [JSON](3.JSON.md) and XML).

For example, a **GET** **request** to the following Facebook Graph API endpoint responds with the user information.

```
http://graph.facebook.com/v3.0/{user-id}
```

As another example, Google **Geocoding** **API** request takes the following form:

```
http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json
```

It is important to design **intuitive** **and** **convenient** **API**. Request to API URLs [HTTP](2.HTTP.md) methods, such as GET, POST, PUT or DETELE.
