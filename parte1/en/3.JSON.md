# Introduction to JSON 
**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, readable format for structuring data. its main usage is to transmit data from server to client as an alternative to XML.

A JSON is a strinf whose format very much resembles JavaScript Object literal format. It maps **keys** to **values**.
**For** **example**:

```js
{
    "firstname": "David",
    "lastname": "Smith",
    "age": "42"
}
```

In the above JSON, the key "firstname" is mapped to the value "David". The **key** is always a string enclosed in quotation marks. The **value** can be anything -a string, number, boolean, array, or object. Key/value pairs are comma-separated.

The JSON object starts and ends with braces { }. You can also have a JSON object as a value for a key.
**For** **example**:

```js
{
    "registered": "2016-1-10",
    "courses": ["JS","C++","Python"],
    "active": true,
    "id": 01234,
    "age": null,
    "activity":{
        "challenges": 10,
        "friends": 24,
        "last_activity": 1500646159
    }
}
```

In the code above, the **"activity"** key contains another JSON object.

JSON is more readable and more lightweight compared to XML.
Let's see how the same data from the above example would look like in XML.

```js
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
<user>
   <registered>2016-1-10</registered>
   <courses>
       <course>JS</course>
       <course>C++</course>
       <course>Python</course>
   </courses>
   <active>true</active>
   <id>01234</id>
   <age/>
   <activity>
       <challenges>10</challenges>
       <friends>24</friends>
       <last_activity>1500646159</last_activity>
   </activity>
</user>
```

As you can see, JSON is clearly better ins terms of readability and lenght.

>JSON requires double quotes to be used around and property names: Single quotes are not valid. Remember, JSON is only data format. Many programming languages support parsing and using JSON.
