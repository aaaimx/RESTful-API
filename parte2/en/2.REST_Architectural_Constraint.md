# REST Architectural Constraint

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) advocates that web applications should use **HTTP** as it was originally envisioned. Lookups should use GET requests. PUT, POST, and DELETE requests should be used for mutations, creations and deletion respectively.

REST allows independient evolution of the application without having the application's services, models, or actions **tightly** **coupled** to the API layer itself.

This uniform interface should provide an **unchanging**, **standarized** means of communicating between the client and the server, such as using **HTTP** **with** **URI** **resources**, **CRUD** ( Create ,Read, Update, Delete), and **JSON**

While designing REST API, try to make all client-server interaction **stateless**. The server shouldn't store anything about latest HTTP request client made. It should treat **every** **request** **as** **new**.
If the client app need to keep states for an end user, then each request should contain all the information necessaryto service the request(**including** **authenttication** **and** **authorization** **details**).

>Because a stateless API can increase request overhead by handling large loads of incoming and outbound calls, a REST API should be designed to encourage the storage of **cacheable** **data**.
