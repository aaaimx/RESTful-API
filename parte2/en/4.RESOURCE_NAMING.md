# Resource Naming

It is important to follow **naming** **conventions** to make your REST API look professional, readable and esay to use. You should treat resources as a **thing(noun)** instead of an **action** **(verb)**. The main reason is that nouns have properties but verbs don't. Let's see some example of resources:

```
http://api.example.com/users/
http://api.example.com/users/{id}
```
> Use nouns instead of verbs to represent resources.

To simplify this further, let's discuss 4 different types of resources, which will help you to choose a correct naming convention for your API.


##### Document
This type of resource is a singular concept(object). In REST API, you can view (get) it as a single resource inside the collection. Use "singular" name to imply **document** resource type.

```
http://api.example.com/users/{id}
http;//api.example.com/users/{id}/posts
```

##### Store
A store resource is a directory in which a user(client) decides when to add or remove from there. Use a "plural" name to imply a **store** resource type.

```
http://api.example.com/users/{id}/projects
http;//api.example.com/users/{id}/playlists
```

##### Controller
A controller resource is an action concept. Controller resources act like functions which may take parameters as an input and return an output. Use a "verb" to imply a  **controller** resource type.

```
http://api.example.com/users/{id}/projects/run
http;//api.example.com/users/{id}/playlists/play
```
